Flights Data: Example 
For each airline, u = 1,..., 16:
Y_1 = Flight time between airports (Airtime) - s_1 = 12 histogram sub-intervals,
Y_2 = Time to taxi in to the gate after landing (Taxi-In-Time) - s_2 = 12 histogram sub-intervals,
Y_3 = Time arrived after scheduled arrival time (Arrival-Delay-Time) - s_3 = 11 histogram sub-intervals,
Y_4 = Time to taxi out from the gate until liftoff (Taxi-Out-Time) - s_4 = 10 histogram sub-intervals,
Y_5 = Delay time after scheduled departure time (Departure-Delay-Time) - s_5 = 11 histogram sub-intervals.
